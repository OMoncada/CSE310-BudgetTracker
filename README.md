# CSE310-BudgetTracker
Income and Expense Log

# Budget Tracker (JavaScript Project)

This is a **Budget Tracker** web app made with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows the user to record monthly **expenses** and **incomes**, mark expenses as paid, and automatically calculate the current balance.  
All data is stored in the **browser using localStorage**, so the information remains saved even after closing the browser.
